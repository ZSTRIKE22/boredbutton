## Why?

Why not?\
``bored`` can:\
- make a fun addition to your ricing screenshots
- make you less bored (duh)
- be used as a random string picker

## Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/knuxfanwin8/boredbutton
cd boredbutton
sudo make install
make ideainstall
```

It's that simple!

## Usage

Run ``bored`` from command line. Run ``boredconf`` for configuration.

## Compatibility with older versions

Your lists from older versions will work, as long as you move them to the right directory. You can also remove the ``"`` characters from the file.
